Hi, my wife and I are thinking of leasing some land in the Charlottesville area within the next few years and starting to practice sustainable agriculture. We're excited to get more involved in the movement to create accountable, small-scale food. Multiple people in my family have Lyme's and we've learned over the years the importance of healthy, local eating. Any advice about or experiences of farming in the Charlottesville area would be helpful. You can reach us at erickucks@gmail.com or 571-386-1806.
