Hi, my wife and I are thinking of leasing some land in the Charlottesville area within the next few years and starting to learn sustainable agriculture practices. We're excited to get more involved in the movement to create accountable, small, healthy food. Multiple people in my family have Lyme's... We were wondering if you would have time at some point to have a phone conversation to hear about your experiences
