* Vertical
  - zip grow towers
    - www.zipgrow.com
    - lightweight
    - media based
    - durable
    - no anaroebic zones
    - only grows on one side because sunlight is unidirectional and these don't
      try to grow plants on the low light side, where they don't grow well
    - also easier to move, take to market, etc
  - redworms
    - consume organic waste and mineralize them to make them more plant available
    - order them online
    - put them in worm bins (tupperware tubs with drain holes)
    - kitchen waste compost
    - plant seeds into vermicompost in plug trays
    - when transplanting plugs into towers, these inject worms into towers
    - increase percolation
* Medium
  - fiber
    - high percolation
    - low weight
    - polyester
    - lots of surface area
    - durable
    - buy it at www.brightagrotech.com
  - expanded shale
    - high surface area
    - cheap
    - lightweight
* Sump tanks
  - collection tank for runoff from system
  - two pumps with float switches at different heights for redundancy in sump
    pump
* Fish
  - environmental conditions
  - feed sources
  - purpose
* Greenhouse
  - polyethalene film
* Water
  - chlorine
    - will evaporate after several days
    - need to keep water in separate container that's been evaporated to refill tank with
    - or have dechlorinating filter on faucet
  - chloramine
    - doesn't evaporate
    - hard to get rid of
    - if water has it, use another source of water
  - oxygen
    - more oxygen is better
    - as water falls from growing bed into tank, introduces oxygen
    - could send some water from fish tank back into fish tank instead 
of into grow bed
  - pH
    - best is 6.8 to 7
    - test weekly at least
    - API Freshwater Master TestKit or digit pH meter
    - buffering agent
      - if drops below 6.4
        - calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime) or calcium carbonate (agricultural lime)
        - potassium carbonate or bicarbonate or potassium hydroxide (potash)
      - if rises above 7.6
        - pure or based on nitric or phosphoric acid
        - look out for extra compounds like citric acid
      - fastest way to change pH is do a one-third water change
        - but try not to move pH more than 0.2 in a day
* Fish tanks/grow beds
  - grow bed
    - at least 12 inches deep
    - media guard to facilitate easy cleaning
  - fish tank
    - 250 gallon or larger create most stable aquaponics system
    - need at least 50-gallon volume to raise fish to 12 inches
  - grow bed and fish tank
    - start with 1:1 ratio of grow bed volume to fish tank volume
      - can increase up to 2:1 once system is mature
    - food safe materials
  - grow bed area
    - 1 lb of fish for every 1 sq ft of grow bed surface area
    - 1 lb fish per 5-10 gallons of fish tank volume
    - when fish are young and small, reduce number of plants in proportion
to size of fish
