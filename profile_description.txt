We love health and cooking and have always wanted to be more involved in creating sustainable, accountable, healthy food, both for ourselves and others. Eric is a software engineer and Melody is a piano teacher. We have a four year old son Willem. We have some other family members who are interested in moving to a piece of land with us and starting to learn how to steward it. There would probably be a mix of people with off farm incomes and one or two devoting more time up front. Since we don't have a lot of experience other than some backyard gardening (although we're doing a lot of reading about permaculture!), we'd ideally like to find a land owner who shares our vision of healing the land who would lease it to us cheaply to give us an opportunity to learn and experiment.
