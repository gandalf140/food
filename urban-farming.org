* Urban Soil
** Rubble to soil
   - dirt
     - rake out rocks
     - bring in large amounts of compost and organic fertilizer
** Ongoing fertility
   - at least two inches of compost each bed every spring, maybe mid-season application
   - dried meals and/or liquid applications of compost tea and sea kelp
** Application between crops
   - between crop rotations in hi-rotation beds, compact fertilizers between
     each crop
   - two small coffee cans of broad-spectrum organic fertilizer
   - mid and end-of-season fertility tests
   - compact fertilizers
     - bone meal
     - alfalfa meal
     - blood meal
     - dried manures
     - or a mix
     - hi-rotation crops typically low "feeders", meaning they don't pull very
       much nutrient from the soil
* Land agreements and leases
  - avoid buying land for fast, cheap startup
  - memorandum of understanding
  - pay costs for use of land in fresh weekly produce, delivered to landowner
  - they receive fixed amount between $20-$30 each week of produce
** Negotiating terms and base agreements
   - go over everything very clearly with landlord to avoid any misunderstandings
** Memorandums of understanding
   - not legally binding
   - ask landowners for at least three-year commitment because of work that goes
     into preparing and maintaining site
   - if they have to back out they can (at least ask to finish a season)
** Leases
   - for long term plots
   - legally binding
   - sometimes yearly fee instead of vegetable trade
** Rentals
   - $50 per 2000 square feet per month is reasonable
   - or veggies
* Urban pests 
  - avoid insect pests by rotating crops between sites
  - identify problem
    - attacking a particular crop?
    - during a particular season?
    - maybe move crop or don't plant in that season
** Birds and mammals
   - fencing for deer, dogs, and humans
   - moist soil to keep cats off
   - trapping for raccoons
   - floating row cover fabric for birds
   - baiting and trapping for rats, mice, and voles
   - make pest travel further for food so its vulnerable to predators
   - hidden game camera can be good for troubleshooting
   - maybe don't plan any easily harvested crops (tomatoes, peppers, or roots)
     on that plot
** Insects
   - row crops or avoid planting during insect's gestation cycle
** Defensive location rotation
* Building your farm, one site at a time 
** Turning a lawn into a farm plot
   - what time of year is it?
     - preparing plot this summer to farm next spring or starting early in
       spring to farm right away?
     - wet or dry?
       - wet tilling can be a mess and damage soil
       - hot and dry need another approach to lessen soil damage
   - what's growing on the ground right now?
     - domestic grass?
     - invasive grass?
   - ground hard packed?
*** Starting in the summer or fall
    - ideal to have a lot of lead time, so summer or early fall
    - tarps to smother grass
      - moisten ground before spreading tarps
      - weights along edges of tarps
      - keep tarps on all winter
    - hard packed
      - if really rocky reconsider using that plot.
