* Urban Soil
** Rubble to soil
   - dirt
     - rake out rocks
     - bring in large amounts of compost and organic fertilizer
** Ongoing fertility
   - at least two inches of compost each bed every spring, maybe mid-season application
   - dried meals and/or liquid applications of compost tea and sea kelp
** Application between crops
   - between crop rotations in hi-rotation beds, compact fertilizers between
     each crop
   - two small coffee cans of broad-spectrum organic fertilizer
   - mid and end-of-season fertility tests
   - compact fertilizers
     - bone meal
     - alfalfa meal
     - blood meal
     - dried manures
     - or a mix
     - hi-rotation crops typically low "feeders", meaning they don't pull very
       much nutrient from the soil
* Land agreements and leases
  - avoid buying land for fast, cheap startup
  - memorandum of understanding
  - pay costs for use of land in fresh weekly produce, delivered to landowner
  - they receive fixed amount between $20-$30 each week of produce
** Negotiating terms and base agreements
   - go over everything very clearly with landlord to avoid any misunderstandings
** Memorandums of understanding
   - not legally binding
   - ask landowners for at least three-year commitment because of work that goes
     into preparing and maintaining site
   - if they have to back out they can (at least ask to finish a season)
** Leases
   - for long term plots
   - legally binding
   - sometimes yearly fee instead of vegetable trade
** Rentals
   - $50 per 2000 square feet per month is reasonable
   - or veggies
* Urban pests 
  - avoid insect pests by rotating crops between sites
  - identify problem
    - attacking a particular crop?
    - during a particular season?
    - maybe move crop or don't plant in that season
** Birds and mammals
   - fencing for deer, dogs, and humans
   - moist soil to keep cats off
   - trapping for raccoons
   - floating row cover fabric for birds
   - baiting and trapping for rats, mice, and voles
   - make pest travel further for food so its vulnerable to predators
   - hidden game camera can be good for troubleshooting
   - maybe don't plan any easily harvested crops (tomatoes, peppers, or roots)
     on that plot
** Insects
   - row crops or avoid planting during insect's gestation cycle
** Defensive location rotation
* Building your farm, one site at a time 
** Turning a lawn into a farm plot
   - what time of year is it?
     - preparing plot this summer to farm next spring or starting early in
       spring to farm right away?
     - wet or dry?
       - wet tilling can be a mess and damage soil
       - hot and dry need another approach to lessen soil damage
   - what's growing on the ground right now?
     - domestic grass?
     - invasive grass?
   - ground hard packed?
*** Starting in the summer or fall
    - ideal to have a lot of lead time, so summer or early fall
    - tarps to smother grass
      - moisten ground before spreading tarps
      - weights along edges of tarps
      - keep tarps on all winter
    - hard packed
      - if really rocky reconsider using that plot.
*** Starting in the spring
    - seven stages
      - remove the grass
        - rent a sod cutter
        - run in straight lines to roll sod off
      - rototill
        - go over multiple times
        - if still large chunks of earth, more passes
        - if ground is uneven may need landscaping rake to level out
      - form out the beds
        - maybe use string lines as guides
        - walk next to tiller, so you're not stepping on tilled soil
        - width of bed should be width of tiller
        - or use a rake
        - walkways 6 to 18 inches
      - rake out debris - rocks, roots and rhizomes
        - may be good idea to let it sit a few days so that debris floats to the
          surface 
        - then rake it out
        - may have to do multiple times if invasive grass
      - loosen subsoil
        - use strong pitchfork or broadfork and drive it into the bed deep as it can go then pull out gently, driving it down every foot
      - add amendments
        - finished compost and organic fertilizers
        - two inch layer
        - two eight gallon buckets of compost for each 25 foot bed
      - prepare beds for planting
        - rototill or tilther to mix amendments in
*** Starting any time with large plots
    - if preparing 1/4 acre or larger, may want to consider brining in heavier machinery
    - maybe hire someone with a tractor
    - with 1/4 acre or more stages
      - remove the grass with a front end loader or tractor
        - maybe a bucket to scrape off top one inch
        - or a tractor to loosen subsoil with subsoiler implement
      - loosen the subsoil with a tractor
      - till with a tractor
      - form out the beds with walk behind tractor
      - rake out debris - rocks, roots, and rhizomes
      - add amendments
      - till the beds to prepare for planting
** Choosing a site
*** Your first site
    - if looking for home base (where you can keep tools, infrastructure, and
      work from), you want to have it in an area where there are other pieces of
      land nearby
    - maybe start with neighbors/uncles garage
    - then find land close to this
    - use mapping software
    - look at area of town you want to be in
      - amenities nearby
      - farmers market
      - potential restaurants
      - homes with big lawns
      - place with good visibility
*** Satellite farms
    - wait to expand
    - let other landowners come to you
    - put a sign on first plot, saying what it is and contact info
    - eventually all plots of land close to each other
    - when moving away from plot, seed grass again or let them take over garden
    - plots furthest away, bi-rotation with low maintenance
      - kale, carrots, beets, scallions, chard, peppers and eggplant
** Garden layout
*** Standardization
    - quick crops don't need as much space, maybe 6-8 inch walkway
    - BR plots have at least one foot wide walkways
*** Factors affecting layout
    - layout often based on track sun follows, drainage or trade winds
    - other factors in urban farms are shade obstructions and shape of plot itself
    - try to run beds 25 to 50 foot lengths but not always possible
    - maximize growing space and minimize areas that are less important like
      walkways and perimeters
    - main reason for standard length is consistency in irrigation, season
      extension equipment, and any pest protection row covers
*** Sunlight and shade
    - critical when deciding how to configure layout
** The perimeter
*** Access points
    - how to get in and out of plot
    - fences, gates, existing walkways, hedges, trees and house location
    - make sure access points allow machine access (rototiller)
*** Sheet mulching
    - where long term tenure, sheet mulch perimeter with wood whicps
    - wood chips for free from some local arborists (in fall)
*** Landscape fabric
